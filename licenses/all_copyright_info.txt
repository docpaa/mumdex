** I try to only use third-party software if it has a stable interface for at least 20 years, or if I can legally and easily modify it for my needs and distribute it as part of my codebase.  I distribute source and not binaries.

>> A limited amount of my code includes non-standard (not c/c++ standard) header files that users need to have installed on their systems if they want to compile certain programs.  I currently limit myself to including these headers:

my x11plot.h includes X11/Xlib.h, X11/Xutil.h and X11/keysym.h

my cngsl.h includes gsl/gsl_cdf.h

my haha.h includes gsl/gsl_{cdf,randist}.h (does not exist yet in published code)

my python_mumdex.cpp includes Python.h

** The rest of my borrowed code is included with my package download, and has been heavily edited to suit my needs and tastes and to survive my harsh compiler warning options.  I distribute the modified code and the original licenses:

>> some suffix array code in my fasta.h, longSA.h, qsufsort.h, mummer.cpp was taken from the sparseMEM package.  Thir original license is:
